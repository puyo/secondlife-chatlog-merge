Run this command to merge SL chatlogs from various SL clients and operating
systems into a directory in your Dropbox account.

Requires Ruby 1.8.

This script is written for my own convenience. You will need to edit the script
before running it like so:

  ruby1.8 secondlife-chatlog-merge.rb <sl_username> [logname, ...]
